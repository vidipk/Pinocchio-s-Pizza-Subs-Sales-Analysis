1. Retrieve the total number of orders placed.
2. Calculate the total revenue generated from pizza sales.
3. Identify the highest-priced pizza.
4. Identify the most common pizza size ordered.
5. List the top 5 most ordered pizza types along with their quantities.
6. Find the total quantity of each pizza category ordered.
7. Determine the distribution of orders by hour of the day.
8. Find the category-wise distribution of pizzas.
9. Calculate the average number of pizzas ordered per day.
10. Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue.
11. Analyze the cumulative revenue generated over time.
12. Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue for each pizza category.
